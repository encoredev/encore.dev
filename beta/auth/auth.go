// Passing in an empty string as the uid results in unsetting the auth information,
// causing future API calls to behave as if there was no authenticated user.
//
// If the application's auth handler returns custom auth data, two additional
// requirements exist. First, the data parameter passed to WithContext must be of
// the same type as the auth handler returns. Second, if the uid argument is not
// the empty string then data may not be nil. If these requirements are not met,
// API calls made with these options will not be made and will immediately return
// a client-side error.
